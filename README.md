# Donald Trump tweet study - #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain
I scraped all the tweets containing the hashtag `#MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain` that were posted in March, 2016. For more details about the project check out my [blog post](https://galeascience.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/where-are-the-haters-at-a-twitter-study-on-donald-trump/).

This reposity contains my ipython notebook `drumpf_notebook.ipynb` which includes the entire analysis. High resolution figures can be found in the folder `final_figures`. Here are a few:

I've also included the results of a lengthy calcualtion in the folder `14_hr_location_to_state_calculation`, where the tweet user locations (as input by the user) are converted to US states. I created a [US city-to-state dictionary](https://galeascience.wordpress.com/2016/03/23/us-city-to-state-python-dictionary/) for this purpose.

The tweets themselves (in .JSON format) were not included. Their total size is 2.5 GB.
